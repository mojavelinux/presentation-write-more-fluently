=== Examples

  - screenshot of https://github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/ perhaps?
* Image of clean (physical) workspace for "Remove the clutter"
* Picture of keyboard, either with heatmap, touch typing hands, or vim shortcuts, for "Travel with your fingers"
* GitHub contribution graph for "Make progress every day"
  - "you know you need to up your game when your shower contributes more to GitHub than you do"
