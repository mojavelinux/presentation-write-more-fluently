It will also become clear where the gaps are in your understanding or the storyline so you know what else to research.</p>

<section class="listing"><pre><code>= Better Collaboration Leads to Better Docs
Sarah White
v1.0.0

Why is it so difficult to collaborate on documentation?
We believe it's because collaboration procedures are often accidental.
Managing collaboration as a core requirement leads to a better content workflow.

== Traditional file sharing is tedious, imprecise &amp; inefficient

When a team uses tools that don't provide versioning and merging to collaborate on documentation, the team members can't see who is working on the files, the files get out of sync, authorship and accountability are lost, and edits have to be manually evaluated and integrated into the final document.

When the body of documentation becomes too difficult to manage using these informal methods, many businesses decide to buy a content management system (CMS).
However, a CMS is typically expensive, requires a lot of special knowledge and training, may not integrate with the publishing and distribution platforms the business uses, and can be difficult to customize to the team's workflow.
Additionally, a CMS still may not provide a solution for all of the team's collaboration requirements, uses, or tasks.

== A CMS isn't a silver bullet solution

CMSs are typically expensive and monolithic.
They may be good at providing a workflow but they may not assign authorship to integrated content, they may let people edit but not leave notes, they may make editing in situ impossible, they may not track analytics, they may not provide indexes that allows content to be tagged, easily found and used in other outputs, they may not track where the content is being used and offer suggestions or warnings about its state to writers, editors, managers and users.
And due to their inflexibility, it is difficult to customize the CMS to the team's desired specifications which means they will still have to use other tools to complete their work.
Additionally, subject matter experts (SMEs) and other collaborators not directly writing the documentation may find the CMS a barrier to entry due to security protocols or the inability to use the CMS without extensive training.

== It's a problem when SMEs can't access the CMS or use it well

If all of the people needed to create and write quality documentation do not have access to the CMS, the team will still suffer from the same frustrations of an email, non-version, non-merge system as well as inefficiency and ineffectiveness caused by a CMS that doesn't adequately match the documentation and business requirements of the writing team.

== Collaboration on documentation is business requirement

An easy to learn, use and manage collaboration system is a business requirement because if all of the people who need to be involved in the planning, drafting and finalization of the the documentation content can't work together efficiently and accurately they'll become disengaged and frustrated.

In turn, these difficulties and the feelings they cause will impact the quality of the content (inaccurate information, out-of-date information, poorly organized and written content, incomplete content) which will make people even less likely to work on it or use it.
Poor quality documentation directly impacts the adoption of the company's software, and then its reputation and success.

== Takeaway

Putting in place all of the documentation team's collaboration requirements without undo complexity and with respect to how the team works leads to quality content.
Each person who touches the content feels relaxed, secure and engaged in the creation process.

<aside role="note"><p>Organize the remaining lines under these sections.
Throw out any lines that don&#8217;t fit in these big ideas.
Fold points into sentences.
Let the story the content wants to tell emerge.</p>

You now have a first draft of your document done.</p></aside></section>
<section class="topic hack-2"><h2>Fill in the blanks</h2><aside role="note"><p>Hack #2: Fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>Another path you can take to get to a first draft is to begin with a template, then just fill in the blanks.</p></aside></section>
<section class="listing"><pre><code>= Q: What is the project's name?

//Q: Why does this project exist?

== Q: How do I install it?

== Q: Can you show me how it's used?

== Q: How do I contribute?

== Q: Who wrote it? What's the license?</code></pre>
<aside role="note"><p>This approach works particularly well for technical documentation such as a tutorial, guide, or README.
We can build on the &#8220;Answer a question&#8221; brain hack from part 1 by making the template an outline of questions.</p>
<p>With the outline already set, you can focus your brain power on the responses.
The pre-defined structure also reminds you not to leave out a topic or critical step and it encourages consistency from one project to another.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Once you&#8217;re done filling out this questionnaire, simply swap each question with a statement or topic and, voila, your first draft is done!</p>
<p>Each time you fill in the blanks, you&#8217;ll gain new insights about how to improve the template.
For instance, you&#8217;ll discover sections that are missing, better ways to phrase the questions, or identify additional common elements you can move to the template.
If you continuously invest these changes back into the template, the practice of filling in the blanks gets easier each time, and gets you to a first draft quicker.</p></aside></section>

The processor automatically populates these templates and weaves the result into the published document.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the fastest way to write content is to not have to write the content at all!
Not only do content macros save a lot of effort, they also shift the responsibility of maintaining that portion of the content to the content owner.
And since the content is centralized, updates can be pushed out to all documents that import them.</p></aside></section>

== Conclusion

"`That's all, folks!`"</code></pre>
<aside role="note"><p>One of the reasons I find it so easy to write in AsciiDoc is because it&#8217;s mostly just lines of text.
There are hints of markup here and there, but mostly it&#8217;s uncluttered.
The reaction many writers have when they first switch from a syntax laden with XML tags like DocBook to AsciiDoc is, &#8220;I can finally see my content!&#8221;
You&#8217;re brought closer to your content and that intimacy allows you to form a deeper connection.
That&#8217;s when the ideas really start to flow.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>When you do need to add formatting marks, be frugal about it!
Just because AsciiDoc has a rich syntax doesn&#8217;t mean you have to use all of it at once.
If you must to apply special formatting for a term, by all means, do it.
But don&#8217;t fall into the trap of marking up stuff just because you can.
When everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.
Before you know it, you&#8217;ll be marking up all the parts of speech!</p>
<p>As a general habit, I like to use the minimum number of characters possible to markup the document.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>This comes up in AsciiDoc in places like section titles, delimited blocks, and attributes for phrases or blocks.
You can write a section title using leading equal signs or you can underline the section title.
Why type more than you can.
Stick to single-line section titles.
Most blocks consist of delimiter lines with four or more characters.
Again, why type more than you have to.
Keep your block delimiters at four characters.
Asciidoctor features a shorthand for defining the common attributes on a phrase or block such as the id, role, or options.
Use them!</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, only write what you have to.
Be vigilant about removing clutter both in the document and in the physical space around you and you&#8217;ll give your brain plenty of room to work.</p></aside></section>

<section class="image" style="background-image: url(images/keyboard-typing.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat">
<aside role="note"><p>One way to write fluently is to keep your hands on the keyboard and travel around the document using only your fingers.
The locomotion of continuously pressing keys gives you momentum that leads right into typing words and phrases.
And there are certainly enough keys and key combinations on the keyboard that you don&#8217;t need to reach for those few buttons on your mouse.</p></aside></section>
<section class="poster"><figure class="image"><img src="images/vim-logo.svg" alt="vim logo"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>I do all my writing in Vim.
Vim is a text editor that&#8217;s controlled entirely using the keyboard.
You use the keyboard to open a file, to move the cursor around, to add text, and to save the file.
You use the keyboard to do everything.
You can even split the screen to look at multiple files at once or different parts of the same file.
And its bread and butter is working with plain text, so AsciiDoc is a natural fit.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet, I strongly recommend that you at least give a keyboard-focused editor like Vim or Emacs a try.
It&#8217;s a little daunting at first, for sure, but it gives you a certain freedom that you&#8217;ve likely never experienced before.
All I can say is that there&#8217;s no way I could write without Vim now.
And I&#8217;m not even really that good at using it.</p></aside></section>
<section class="image" style="background-image: url(images/vim-editing-session.png); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat">
<aside role="note"><p>The fact that I use the keyboard to navigate the document is one of the reasons I advocate so strongly to use sentence per line when writing AsciiDoc.
As I cover in part 1 of this series, sentence per line is a technique in which you put each sentence on its own line.
Since AsciiDoc doesn&#8217;t preserve endlines within normal paragraph text, this doesn&#8217;t affect the output.</p>
<p>Using this arrangement, I can navigate between sentences just by moving the cursor up and down (using keys on the home row, of course).
I can delete a sentence by typing kbd:[dd].
I can comment out or reenable a sentence by inserting <code>//</code> at the beginning of the line.
I can split a paragraph into two by typing kbd:[O].
I can swap sentences around using a combination of kbd:[dd] and kbd:[kP] or kbd:[p].
I can quickly reorder paragraphs as well.
I can manipulate multiple sentences at once using a visual block.
I can jump around in the document using a regex search.
All this control saves me from the disruption of reaching for the mouse and attempting to scissor and stitch the fundamental element of content, the sentence.
There&#8217;s so much more I won&#8217;t even mention here.</p>
<p>Best of all, you&#8217;ll get total hacker cred for writing using Vim.
You&#8217;ll have so many developer friends, you won&#8217;t ever get lost writing a technical document again.
If that doesn&#8217;t help you write fluently, I don&#8217;t know what will.</p></aside></section>

Knowing that you&#8217;re going to get feedback on your writing is also an important motivator.
That feedback brings new ideas and questions to answer, all of which can help fuel your writing.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Once the writer&#8217;s changes are merged into master (you are using git to manage your content, right?), everything that needs to happen to publish the content after that should be automatic and instant.
The workhorse here is the CI server like Travis or Jenkins.
The CI job detects the updates on master, kicks off the build, and synchronizes the output files to the web host (or wherever the content needs to go to be accessible).</p>
<p>Knowing that there&#8217;s a direct path to production really gives you as a writer the motivation to write, to refine your words, and to get your content out into the world.
In essence, we&#8217;re taking the practice of continuous delivery from development and bringing it to the writing world as the &#8220;push to publish&#8221; workflow.</p></aside></section>
<section class="image" style="background-image: url(images/published-page.png); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat">
<aside role="note"><p>Regardless of the workflow, when a change is merged into master, no human should have to get involved to publish those changes.
It&#8217;s just push to publish.</p></aside></section>
<section class="topic hack-7"><h2>Make progress every day</h2><aside role="note"><p>Hack #7: Make progress every day.</p>
<p>I remember when I first heard the tagline, &#8220;Make progress every day.&#8221;
I immediately thought to myself, &#8220;Wow, if there was ever a rally cry to be mediocre, this has to be it.&#8221;
I&#8217;ve grown older and wiser since then.</p></aside></section>
<section class="poster"><figure class="image"><img src="images/construction-time-lapse.jpg" alt="construction time lapse"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>I now believe this hack is the subtle secret to great success, in writing or anything else.
Don&#8217;t try to do everything.
Just do something.
Then do it every day.</p>
<p>Imagine if the tagline had been, &#8220;Do something amazing every day.&#8221;
That&#8217;s just too much pressure.
People react in one of two ways:</p>
<ol><li><span class="primary">They stress about how to make something great.</span></li><li><span class="primary">They snub their nose at it and rebel.</span></li></ol>
<p>Either way, the outcome is the same.
They aren&#8217;t productive.</p>
<p>The suggestion to make progress every day is far more effective.
If you think about writing the final draft of a document from start to finish, you&#8217;ll never get to it.
If, instead, you just get something down, and don&#8217;t let the day go by without making some progress, it feels achievable.</p></aside></section>
<section class="poster"><figure class="image"><img src="images/heatmap.png" alt="heatmap"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>To get into the habit, you need to learn to give yourself credit for progress.
I use the same workflow for writing that I use for development.
I file an issue for the improvement; that&#8217;s a contribution.
I submit a pull request with the change; that&#8217;s a contribution.
I review and merge that change; that&#8217;s a contribution.
Each step along the way, I credit myself for the work I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>The feeling of being productive is fulfilling, even intoxicating, so you keep doing it.
It&#8217;s a virtuous cycle.
This leads to a flow state.
Before long, you&#8217;re writing fluently.
This is indeed the ultimate brain hack.</p></aside></section>
